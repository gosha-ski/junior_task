  '"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:',
  'And on the pedestal these words appear:',
  'And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,',
  'Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,',
  'I met a traveller from an antique land',
  'Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"',
  'Nothing beside remains. Round the decay',
  'Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare',
  'Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,',
  'Tell that its sculptor well those passions read',
  'The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:',
  'The lone and level sands stretch far away.',
  'Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,',
  'Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone'
